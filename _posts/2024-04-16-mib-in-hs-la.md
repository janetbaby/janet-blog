Here’s a close‑up look at the **Master’s in International Business** programme at Hochschule Landshut—focused entirely on the course structure, specialisations, and what international students can expect.

---

##  Programme Overview

- **Degree**: Master of Arts (M.A.) in International Business Administration  
- **Duration**: 3 semesters (90 ECTS), full‑time  
- **Language**: Taught ~80 % in English; German modules also included; thesis submitted in English  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Structure**: Two theoretical semesters followed by a Master’s thesis and colloquium  :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

##  Core Modules (Semester 1 at Landshut)

In the first semester, all core modules are taught in English (except one German‑taught course):

- International Business Environment & Strategy  
- Global Operations Management  
- Innovation Management  
- International Financial Management  
- Agile & Hybrid Project Management in an International Environment  
- Kundenmanagement *(taught in German)*  :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

##  Semester 2 & 3: Specialisation & Thesis

- **Semester 2**: Option to study abroad at a partner university (double‑degree option) —specialisation tracks available (e.g. finance, marketing, HR) depending on host institution.  
  Alternately, students may remain in Landshut, selecting elective modules via the Virtual University of Bavaria (VHB) plus on‑campus English instruction. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

- **Semester 3**: Focus on research methods and completion of major project or Master’s thesis in English, including a thesis defence colloquium. Modular scheduling allows flexible sequencing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

##  International Orientation & Degree Flexibility

- Students are encouraged to spend **one to two semesters abroad** at partner universities in Ireland, Sweden, UK, Spain, or Australia—with the possibility to earn a **double degree**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

- The programme emphasises development of key management skills such as:
  - Strategic and global thinking  
  - Change and innovation management  
  - Intercultural competence and mobility  
  - Sustainable and networked decision‑making  :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

- Students tailor their specialisation via selection of electives abroad or through second‑semester focus choices. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

##  Targeted Outcomes

Upon completion, graduates are equipped for **mid‑ to senior‑level roles** at international and multinational businesses—particularly in domains such as:

- Strategy, marketing, finance, operations  
- Project management and innovation functions  
- Sustainability and corporate responsibility roles in a global context  :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

---

##  Admission Requirements

- A relevant business‑focused Bachelor’s degree (typically ~210 ECTS in business administration) or equivalent; applicants with 180–210 ECTS in business studies may be admitted upon proof of ≥ 900 hours professional experience in economics-related roles. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Proficiency in **English and German** at CEFR level C1. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

##  Why This Course Stands Out

- **Global focus**: strong integration of international business strategy, finance, and operations  
- **High flexibility**: ability to specialise via electives or partner institutions  
- **International mobility**: built‑in study abroad and double degree tracks  
- **English-medium design**: ideal for international students while still including German modules :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
