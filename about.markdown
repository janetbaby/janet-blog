## Hello and Welcome! 

I'm **Janet Baby**, a detail-oriented Financial Accountant with over five years of experience across multinational companies. Iâ€™m currently working as a **Working Student in the Accounts Payable team at Personio, Munich**, while pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in International Business** at Hochschule Landshut.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worn multiple hats in the world of finance â€” from **financial reporting** and **invoice processing** to **general ledger accounting**, **multi-currency reconciliations**, and **compliance support**. My career has taken me through roles in global teams, including as a **Senior Finance Consultant at Tesco Ltd**, where I led supplier dispute resolution, automated AP workflows, and contributed to operational improvements that drove measurable outcomes.

## What Iâ€™m Passionate About

**Accuracy in financial operations**  
**Process improvement through data**  
**Turning raw financial data into strategic insights**  
**Collaborating with cross-functional teams**  
**Lifelong learning in finance, technology & business**

I enjoy applying a structured approach to problem-solving, whether itâ€™s tracking KPIs using Excel, automating financial reports, or ensuring documentation is audit-ready. Tools like **SAP**, **Spendesk**, **Power BI**, and **SQL** are part of my daily toolkit, helping me turn complexity into clarity.

## Why I Started This Blog

This blog is a space for me to share what I learn, experience, and explore in the world of **finance, accounting, and business**. Whether youâ€™re a student, early-career professional, or just curious about the behind-the-scenes of corporate finance, I hope youâ€™ll find value here.

## How I Started This Blog

Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring a bit of the tech world too! With help and curiosity, I learned how to set up this blog using **Jekyll**, a static site generator that works with the **Ruby** programming language. Jekyll allows me to write content in simple Markdown and turn it into a full website without needing complex tools or code.

Itâ€™s an exciting journey to bridge finance with a bit of tech â€” and building this blog from scratch has been both fun and empowering. I hope it inspires others to try new things too!
