## Hi there, I’m Janet 👋

I’m a finance enthusiast who also happens to love hopping on planes, sipping coconut water on sunny beaches, and exploring mountain towns! By day, I’m a **Working Student at Personio in Munich**, supporting the Accounts Payable team while working on my **Master’s in International Business** at **Hochschule Landshut**.

Before this, I worked at **Tesco Ltd** in various finance roles, where I helped sort invoices, analyze data, fix issues, and keep things running smoothly—basically making sure money stuff made sense!

## What I Really Enjoy

💸 Making numbers talk (accurately!)  
📊 Turning messy data into neat reports  
🤝 Working with teams to solve little finance puzzles  
🧠 Learning about AI, finance tools, and new tech  
📈 Keeping processes smooth and audit-ready

I use tools like SAP, Power BI, Excel, and SQL daily—and honestly, getting things automated and organized makes me super happy.

## A Bit About My Adventures

When I’m not deep in Excel sheets or helping close month-end books, I’m probably planning my next getaway. I absolutely love traveling and soaking in new cultures, food, and scenery. Some favorite moments:

🕌 Bangkok & Phuket – street food, temples, and ocean vibes  
🏔️ Hallstatt & Salzburg – fairy-tale villages and mountain trains  
🇨🇭 Zurich – peaceful lakeside walks and chocolate dreams  
🇩🇪 Berlin, Regensburg – history, street art, and cozy cafés  
🌿 Ooty, Calicut – misty hills, beaches and homemade chocolates

## Why This Blog?

This little corner of the internet is where I share what I’m learning—whether it’s finance tricks, ERP tools, or techy experiments like setting up this blog using **Jekyll** (yes, I built this myself with Markdown and a little help from **Ruby programming language!**).

If you’re curious about finance, accounting, or love discovering new places, you’re in the right place. Alongside tips and learnings from my finance journey, I also share my favorite travel stories and snapshots from adventures around the world!
